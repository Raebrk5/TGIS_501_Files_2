    "## Lab purpose\n",
    "This lab takes a step back from working with and within ArcGIS to explore Python as a language in and of itself. In this lab, you’ll be asked to solve a variety of problems using Python. Some of these problems will have immediate applied uses, while others will simply be asking you to think computationally – about what you can and cannot solve using Python and how it might be used in a variety of generalized tasks. You will also gain familiarity with the specific syntax of the Python language.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a wide variety of articles, guides, tutorials, and reference materials available on the Python language. You’re encouraged to read through many of these and refer to them when you run into difficulty. Make sure you understand why any solution works or you will run into significant difficulties later.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will turn in a series of python scripts that you create to solve each problem. You will host them [in the repository here](https://github.com/UWTMGIS/TGIS501_W18/tree/master/lab2). If you are using a notebook, you will enter all of your code here and upload a single .ipynb file with the format LastName.ipynb. If you are uploading individual scripts, they will be LastName_ProblemNumber.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "**It is strongly recommended you work through the entirety of Exercise 4 from the Scripting… book before attempting these problems. This lab may be completed using either python 2 or 3.**"

    "## Problem 1: The Trouble With Turtles\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your age, you may remember playing with a Turtle drawing program in elementary school. The history behind the Turtle is a bit longer (dating back to the 1960s) and “Turtle Graphics” generally refers to a means of drawing vector graphics on a Cartesian plane. You draw by moving an imaginary turtle around the screen. Each turtle (and there can be more than one) has a location, a pen, and an orientation. With simple commands you can draw truly complex shapes.\n",
