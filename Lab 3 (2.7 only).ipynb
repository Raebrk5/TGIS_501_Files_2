It also integrates this work with the means of automating ArcGIS desktop (and some server) through the ArcPy site package. Later on in the course we'll discuss ArcPro and the ArcGIS API for python, but - _in this lab_ - we focus on the more established means of automation.\n",

    "Further, all of the “at risk” and “medium risk” airports must be put into a new shapefile called “Alaska at risk.shp.” You and your boss both know shapefile names can’t have spaces in them, but he insists that you accept the name with spaces and correct for it in python (Here I mean that in your script you have something that accepts a string with spaces and prorammatically removes them - this may seem banal in the context of this exercise, but the ability to correct for errors will pay huge dividends down the road... _pun intended_).\n",
